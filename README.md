		``SWIPL -s es.pl``
  
#### B.if using the app(windows or other):
use the swipl executable console and type:
			``[swi(<your path up to es.pl>/'es.pl')].``
  
##### I don't own a working windows machine, if these instructions don't work as of reading, check the guide at https://www.swi-prolog.org/windows.html
